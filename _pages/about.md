<p>
Engineer/scientist with a desire to apply the concepts learnt to develop real-time, scalable solutions. I work on Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms with an aim to use them for greater efficiency in computer networks and distributed systems but also on any learnable problem in general. </p>

<p>I also explore new areas of research in Software Defined Networking frameworks and programmable networks. Lately, I have also been working on applying NLP methods to social science as an additional research area.</p>

<p> I'm always looking out for research and development opportunities in these fields. </p>

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
